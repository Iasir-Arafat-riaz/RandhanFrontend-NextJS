          To be environmentally sustainable means to be aware of resource
          consumption by reducing unnecessary waste and RONDHAN integrates this
          pillar into its philosophy and actions through various means. Our
          Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) policy covers employees,
          contracted workers and visitors to RONDHAN services and facilities. This
          includes the internal activities, products and services we provide to
          the marketplace. We implement the RONDHAN Supplier Code to influence our
          suppliers to achieve the same standards as well. We facilitate our
          policy through an EHS Management System with various commitments.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        These commitments include, establishing EHS objectives with targets to evaluate results as we continuously strive to improve our performance, identify hazards and aspects and analyze their impacts on EHS performance and implement control to avoid losses or damage to people, environment, equipment, products and assets. We maintain all health and safety protocols and fulfill our charter which states, Together We Will Find a Better Way, by conducting our business in a manner that reduces harm to people and the environment with an ultimate goal of ZERO incidents. All accidents are avoidable according to RONDHAN. There are no exceptions. Click here if you would like to view our EHS Policy.

        We strongly value environmental accountability by taking green initiatives, being more efficient with energy usage and more. Therefore, RONDHAN aggressively pursues pollution prevention, energy conservation, wise use of natural resources and waste reduction. Each of our faucets and light switches in our current, eight offices include a sign which states “please consider your environment” to kindly remind users to conserve water and energy. Though RONDHAN is not entirely paperless yet, our goal is to one day be. We have signs on our printers reminding users to consider their environment before printing to reduce waste and use of natural resources. We even have similar signs on our facial tissue boxes as well!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>RONDHAN undertakes various approaches to select, analyze and synthesize various relevant literature to develop a holistic, transdisciplinary and integrative framework for our IT-enabled business transformation. And we are focused on this transformation because we understand the impacts our business has on the environment on a local and global scale.
