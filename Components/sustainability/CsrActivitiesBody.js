        <p>
          Companies have both a direct and indirect impact on its employees,
          clients and their communities. This is why RONDHAN puts its best foot
          forward when taking care of those who are affected by us in any
          capacity. We contribute ways to improve the lives of people by
          creating reputable jobs, technical goods and services that help meet
          consumer needs, and more inclusive value chains.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In order to meet our standards, RONDHAN strives to promote and support
          equitable, diverse, connected and democratic communities. We
          understand that our impact on people as a corporation has many effects
          and so we develop sustainable models to meet these demands. RONDHAN
          strongly prioritizes human rights and conducts fair practices on any
          given level. We recognize our people as assets and treasure each
          relationship that we have with our clients, communities and each
          other. RONDHAN has a strong grievance policy to present and settle
          workplace disputes. We want our staff members not only to feel, but to
          be valued and feel that the work they do matters. RONDHAN accepts and
          does not discriminate against people of their age, race, religion,
          disability, educational and work background and more. One example of
          this is shown physically in our offices. RONDHAN respects and honors
          those with disabilities. We provide equal opportunity for all
          backgrounds and pride ourselves on having a diverse team of competent
          and well-rounded individuals
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, RONDHAN believes in supporting the health, wellness and
          safety of our people. Therefore, we motivate, train, empower and
          engage our employees, customers and contractors in efforts relating to
          health, safety and environment. We keep our offices as inclusive as
          possible. RONDHAN takes the health of its people very seriously. It has
          come to the point where our tea and coffee machines are walking
          distance away to promote increased physical movement around the
          workplace. RONDHAN also conducts gap analyses in the workspace to ensure
          that the performance between information system and software
          application requirements are successful. We provide superior quality
          customer service through continuous improvement strategies and conduct
          our business in a compliant, responsible, safe and profitable manner.

          In terms of the community, RONDHAN contributes 5% of its profit to Social
          Voice Foundation. We value community engagement and partake in various
          projects to help support them. Our non-profit called, Social Voice
          Foundation, has the great opportunity to feed, clothe and provide
          necessities for those who are less fortunate than us. A portion of our
          proceeds go straight to the foundation.
